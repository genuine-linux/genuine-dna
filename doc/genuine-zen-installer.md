=====================

This program installs genuine linux on a destination disk.

User selects available options throught a zenity-based frontend.

**Features implemented**:

- All user input screens (via zenity)
- Installation procedure, lead by a package list

**Features to be implemented some day**:

- Customize disk partitioning (actually uses a predefined schema)
- Command line arguments (complementary or substitute for zenity inputs)

configuration file
-------------------

The file `vim /etc/genetic/conf.d/installer.conf` holds an
**ordered list** of what packages will be installed in the new
system.
